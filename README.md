# Potion shop
#### Learning project for Epicodus - Website made with React
#### By Shanen Cross

## Project Description
A "potion shop" that keeps track of the "kegs" from which potion drinks are sold.

The shop should fulfill the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and flavor.
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
