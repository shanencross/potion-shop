# Potion Shop
#### Learning project for Epicodus - Website made with React
#### By Shanen Cross

## Project Description
A "potion shop" that keeps track of the "cauldrons" from which potion drinks are sold. Built with React, using both local and shared state.

The shop fulfills the following user stories:
* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available cauldrons. For each cauldron, I want to see its name, brand, price, description, and "magic concentration".
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new cauldron to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a cauldron to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a cauldron. A full cauldron has 124 pints.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a cauldron whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
